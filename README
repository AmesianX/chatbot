CHATBOT
=======

Chatbot is an open source platform for high-school students. With this application 
they can create Facebook or Gtalk/Gmail chatbots. It was developed by LVK (lvklabs.com)
 in conjunction with FaMAF (Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía y Física), for 
Fundación Sadosky. This foundation is a non-profit organization whose goal is to 
promote stronger and closer interaction between industrial, scientific and technological
spheres.
