* Which languages are supported?

  Currently, en_US (default) and es_AR are the only languages supported.


* How to set es_AR as the default language?

  Edit chatbot.conf and add the following lines:

  [Application]
  Language=es_AR


* Can I translate the application to a different language?

  Yes, you can. 

  Instructions:

  1) Download and install Qt 4.7 or higher (http://qt-project.org/downloads)
  2) Make a copy of the file lang/chatbot2_xx_XX.ts
  3) Rename the file and replace xx_XX with your desired language. 
     For instance: chatbot2_en_UK.ts, chatbot2_it_IT.ts or chatbot2_es_ES.ts
  4) Launch Qt Linguist
  5) Let's assume we are translating it_IT. Open chatbot2_it_IT.ts
  6) Translate all the strings. See the Qt Linguist documentation if you don't 
     know how to do it: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/linguist-translators.html
  7) Release the file. Go to the menu: File -> Release
     IMPORTANT: This must create a file chatbot2_it_IT.qm
                Make sure that file is in the lang/ folder. If not, move it.
  8) Edit chatbot.conf and add (or update):
     
     [Application]
     Language=it_IT

  9) Restart Chatbot
