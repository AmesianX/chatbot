        Optional:

  NOTE: Requires Qt SDK >= 4.7.0



 -- How to compile and run tests?

 $ cd ../test-suite
 $ ./run-test-suite.sh [ -a | -u | -e ]

  NOTE: Same dependencies to compile the main project





  (*1) Precompiled static library of QXmpp is already provided for 
  linux32, win32 and mac64. Other OSes will require to compile QXmpp 
  manually. Full sources are available at src/third-party/QXmpp
  
  (*2) Precompiled static library is already provided for linux32 and
  win32. Other OSes will require to compile Freeling manually. Full
  sources are available at src/third-party/Freeling. 
  To disable Freeling remove 'CONFIG += freeling' in chatbot.pro

  (*3) Precompiled static library is already provided for linux32 and
  win32. Other OSes might require to compile Zlib manually. Full
  sources are available at src/third-party/zlib. Zlib is required
  to send GELF messages to a Graylog server. To disable GELF statistic
  support remove 'CONFIG += gelf_stats' in chatbot.pro

  (*4) Precompiled static library is already provided for linux32 and
  win32. Other OSes might require to compile Zlib manually. Full
  sources are available at src/third-party/openssl. OpenSSL is required
  to encrypt data. To disable encryption support remove 'CONFIG += openssl' 
  in chatbot.pro
